//! Aggregation factor.
//!
//! The Bulletproofs protocol allows many range proofs to be proved together,
//! which is faster than proving them individually. [AggregationFactor] is used
//! to determine how many of the range proofs in an inclusion proof are
//! aggregated (proved together). Those that do not form part of the aggregated
//! proof are just proved individually.
//!
//! [AggregationFactor] is an enum with 3 options:
//!
//! Divisor: divide the number of nodes by this number to get the ratio of the
//! nodes to be used in the aggregated proof i.e.
//! `number_of_ranges_for_aggregation = tree_height / divisor` (any decimals are
//! truncated, not rounded). Note:
//! - if this number is 0 it means that none of the proofs should be aggregated
//! - if this number is 1 it means that all of the proofs should be aggregated
//! - if this number is `tree_height` it means that only the leaf node should be
//!   aggregated
//! - if this number is `> tree_height` it means that none of the proofs should
//!   be aggregated
//!
//! Percentage: multiply the `tree_height` by this percentage to get the number
//! of nodes to be used in the aggregated proof i.e.
//! `number_of_ranges_for_aggregation = tree_height * percentage`.
//!
//! Number: the exact number of nodes to be used in the aggregated proof. Note
//! that if this number is `> tree_height` it is treated as if it was equal to
//! `tree_height`.
